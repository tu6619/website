    <li><a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/">Eloquent Java Script</a></li>
 
  <p>An  absolute must for anyone looking to get stuck into JavaScript. I find myself referring to it more and more as I get more comfortable with the language. It contains plenty of interactive examples and exercises that'll stop you switching off mid-paragraph and ensure that you take something away with you every time you dip in.</p>

  </ul>
  <p>An interesting insight into recurrent patterns in JavaScript. Really helpful in developing a heightened awareness of the language that will save you time and energy when you come to implementing your own code.
